## Design Pattern Used

This project follows the **Modular Design Pattern** for frontend structure:

- **Component Reuse**: The navigation bar, footer, and hero sections are consistent and reused across all pages.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Structure (HTML), styling (CSS via Bootstrap and custom styles), and behavior (JavaScript for interactivity like modal, filtering, toggling) are separated for scalability.
- **Behavioral Patterns**:
  - **Strategy Pattern**: The filtering and pricing calculator functions dynamically adjust behavior based on user selections.
  - **Observer Pattern (Lightweight)**: Scroll-based animations and user interactions (e.g., read more toggle, FAQ dropdowns) follow a loosely coupled update mechanism.
